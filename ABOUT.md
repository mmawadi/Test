Eventhough I don't a long experince with java development, the doployment phase was completed smoothly without any problem. I started to face problems while depolying the website on Heroku, but I ended up by deploying it successfully.

While working on this exercise I got to learn about :  github, heroku and junit which its my first time using unit testing in my projects.
